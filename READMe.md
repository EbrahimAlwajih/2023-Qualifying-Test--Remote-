# The solutions of the AI Olympics Qualifying Test (Remote).

### Q1 (Painting Squares): 
Little Ahmed is painting a strip made of squares, but he has a limited number of paint strokes. He can select 2 neighboring unpainted cells and paint both of them red. For example, there are three possible ways to paint a strip of 5 squares with only 2 paint strokes. How many different strips of 8 squares can Ahmed make with exactly three paint strokes?

### Q2 (Nice Pair):
The niceness of a pair $(a,b)$ is the value you will get by subtracting their product from the difference of their squares. 
For example, the niceness of the pair $(7,4)$ is $5$, because $(7^2-4^2)-(7\*4)$ is $5$
Find any pair of numbers with niceness $605$, where both numbers have $4$ digits. If you find a pair $(a,b)$ then write the number $(10000*a)+b$

### Q3 (Run the Code): 
What is the value of 'count' after executing the following code?

```
count = 0
for i in range (16, 109) :
    if i % 7 == 2:
        count += 1
count   
```
