The solutions of the AI Olympics Qualifying Test (Remote) are presented.

Q1: Littel Ahmed is painting a strip made of squares, but he has a limited number of paint strokes. He can select 2 neighboring unpainted cells and paint both of them red. 
For example, there are three possible ways to paint a strip of 5 squares with only 2 paint strokes. 
How many different strips of 8 squares can Ahmed make with exactly three paint strokes?
